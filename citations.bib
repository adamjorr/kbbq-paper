Instead, it uses a pair of Bloom filters, one holding a sample of the input k-mers and the other holding k-mers likely to be correct. As long as the sampling fraction is adjusted in inverse proportion to the depth of sequencing, Bloom filter size can be held constant while maintaining near-constant accuracy. Lighter is parallelized, uses no secondary storage, and is both faster and more memory-efficient than competing approaches while achieving comparable accuracy.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12864-016-2463-2},
	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Minor allele detection in very high coverage sequence data ({\textgreater}1000X) has many applications such as detecting {mtDNA} heteroplasmy, somatic mutations in cancer or tumors, {SNP} calling in pool sequencing, etc., where reads with low frequency are not necessarily sequence error but may instead convey biological information. However, the suitability of common base quality recalibration tools for such applications has not been investigated in detail.
{RESULTS}: We show that the widely used tool {GATK} {BaseRecalibration} has several limitations in minor allele detection. First, {GATK} {IndelRealignment} fails to work if the sequence coverage is above a certain level since it then becomes computationally infeasible. Second, the accuracy of the base quality largely depends on the database of known {SNPs} as the control, which limits the ability of de novo minor allele detection. Third, {GATK} reduces the base quality of sequence errors at the cost of reducing scores for true minor alleles. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel approach called {SEGREG}, which applies segmented regression to control sequences (e.g. {phiX}174 {DNA}) spiked into a sequencing run. Based on simulations {SEGREG} improves both the accuracy of base quality scores and the detection of minor alleles. We further investigate sequence error and recalibration parameters by applying a Logarithm Likelihood Ratio ({LLR}) approach to {SEGREG} recalibrated base quality scores for {phiX}174 {DNA} sequenced to very high coverage, and for {mtDNA} genome sequences previously analyzed for heteroplasmic variants.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our results suggest that {SEGREG} improves base recalibration without suffering the limitations discussed above, and the {LLR} approach benefits from {SEGREG} in identifying more true minor alleles, while avoiding false positives from sequencing error.},

	volume = {7},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0041356},
	abstract = {While the importance of random sequencing errors decreases at higher {DNA} or {RNA} sequencing depths, systematic sequencing errors ({SSEs}) dominate at high sequencing depths and can be difficult to distinguish from biological variants. These {SSEs} can cause base quality scores to underestimate the probability of error at certain genomic positions, resulting in false positive variant calls, particularly in mixtures such as samples with {RNA} editing, tumors, circulating tumor cells, bacteria, mitochondrial heteroplasmy, or pooled {DNA}. Most algorithms proposed for correction of {SSEs} require a data set used to calculate association of {SSEs} with various features in the reads and sequence context. This data set is typically either from a part of the data set being "recalibrated" (Genome Analysis {ToolKit}, or {GATK}) or from a separate data set with special characteristics ({SysCall}). Here, we combine the advantages of these approaches by adding synthetic {RNA} spike-in standards to human {RNA}, and use {GATK} to recalibrate base quality scores with reads mapped to the spike-in standards. Compared to conventional {GATK} recalibration that uses reads mapped to the genome, spike-ins improve the accuracy of Illumina base quality scores by a mean of 5 Phred-scaled quality score units, and by as much as 13 units at {CpG} sites. In addition, since the spike-in data used for recalibration are independent of the genome being sequenced, our method allows run-specific recalibration even for the many species without a comprehensive and accurate {SNP} database. We also use {GATK} with the spike-in standards to demonstrate that the Illumina {RNA} sequencing runs overestimate quality scores for {AC}, {CC}, {GC}, {GG}, and {TC} dinucleotides, while {SOLiD} has less dinucleotide {SSEs} but more {SSEs} for certain cycles. We conclude that using these {DNA} and {RNA} spike-in standards with {GATK} improves base quality score recalibration.},

To reach this goal, improved automation will be essential, and it is particularly important that human involvement in sequence data processing be significantly reduced or eliminated. Progress in this respect will require both improved accuracy of the data processing software and reliable accuracy measures to reduce the need for human involvement in error correction and make human review more efficient. Here, we describe one step toward that goal: a base-calling program for automated sequencer traces, phred, with improved accuracy. phred appears to be the first base-calling program to achieve a lower error rate than the {ABI} software, averaging 40\%-50\% fewer errors in the data sets examined independent of position in read, machine running conditions, or sequencing chemistry.},

{RESULTS}: Here we present {ReQON}, a tool that recalibrates the base quality scores from an input {BAM} file of aligned sequencing data using logistic regression. {ReQON} also generates diagnostic plots showing the effectiveness of the recalibration. We show that {ReQON} produces quality scores that are both more accurate, in the sense that they more closely correspond to the probability of a sequencing error, and do a better job of discriminating between sequencing errors and non-errors than the original quality scores. We also compare {ReQON} to other available recalibration tools and show that {ReQON} is less biased and performs favorably in terms of quality score accuracy.
{CONCLUSION}: {ReQON} is an open source software package, written in R and available through Bioconductor, for recalibrating base quality scores for next-generation sequencing data. {ReQON} produces a new {BAM} file with more accurate quality scores, which can improve the results of downstream analysis, and produces several diagnostic plots showing the effectiveness of the recalibration.},

Inaccuracies in these quality scores propagate through all subsequent analyses; thus base quality score recalibration is a standard step in many next-generation sequencing workflows, resulting in improved variant calls. Current base quality score recalibration algorithms rely on the assumption that sequencing errors are already known; for human resequencing data, relatively complete variant databases facilitate this. However, because existing databases are still incomplete, recalibration is still inaccurate; and most organisms do not have variant databases, exacerbating inaccuracy for non-human data. To overcome these logical and practical problems, we introduce Lacer, which recalibrates base quality scores without assuming knowledge of correct and incorrect bases and without requiring knowledge of common variants. Lacer is the first logically sound, fully general, and truly accurate base recalibrator. Lacer enhances variant identification accuracy for resequencing data of human as well as other organisms (which are not accessible to current recalibrators), simultaneously improving and extending the benefits of base quality score recalibration to nearly all ongoing sequencing projects.

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Short-read, next-generation sequencing ({NGS}) is now broadly used to identify rare or
            de novo
            mutations in population samples and disease cohorts. However, {NGS} data is known to be error-prone and post-processing pipelines have primarily focused on the removal of spurious mutations or “false positives” for downstream genome datasets. Less attention has been paid to characterizing the fraction of missing mutations or “false negatives” ({FN}). Here we interrogate several publically available human {NGS} autosomal variant datasets using corresponding Sanger sequencing as a truth-set. We examine both low-coverage Illumina and high-coverage Complete Genomics genomes. We show that the {FN} rate varies between 3\%-18\% and that false-positive rates are considerably lower ({\textless}3\%) for publically available human genome callsets like 1000 Genomes. The {FN} rate is strongly dependent on calling pipeline parameters, as well as read coverage. Our results demonstrate that missing mutations are a significant feature of genomic datasets and imply additional fine-tuning of bioinformatics pipelines is needed. To address this, we design a phylogeny-aware tool [{PhyloFaN}] which can be used to quantify the {FN} rate for haploid genomic experiments, without additional generation of validation data. Using {PhyloFaN} on ultra-high coverage {NGS} data from both Illumina {HiSeq} and Complete Genomics platforms derived from the 1000 Genomes Project, we characterize the false negative rate in human {mtDNA} genomes. The false negative rate for the publically available {mtDNA} callsets is 17-20\%, even for extremely high coverage haploid data.},

	abstract = {A feature common to all {DNA} sequencing technologies is the presence of base-call errors in the sequenced reads. The implications of such errors are application specific, ranging from minor informatics nuisances to major problems affecting biological inferences. Recently developed "next-gen" sequencing technologies have greatly reduced the cost of sequencing, but have been shown to be more error prone than previous technologies. Both position specific (depending on the location in the read) and sequence specific (depending on the sequence in the read) errors have been identified in Illumina and Life Technology sequencing platforms. We describe a new type of systematic error that manifests as statistically unlikely accumulations of errors at specific genome (or transcriptome) locations.},

	abstract = {We identified the sequence-specific starting positions of consecutive miscalls in the mapping of reads obtained from the Illumina Genome Analyser ({GA}). Detailed analysis of the miscall pattern indicated that the underlying mechanism involves sequence-specific interference of the base elongation process during sequencing. The two major sequence patterns that trigger this sequence-specific error ({SSE}) are: (i) inverted repeats and (ii) {GGC} sequences. We speculate that these sequences favor dephasing by inhibiting single-base elongation, by: (i) folding single-stranded {DNA} and (ii) altering enzyme preference. This phenomenon is a major cause of sequence coverage variability and of the unfavorable bias observed for population-targeted methods such as {RNA}-seq and {ChIP}-seq. Moreover, {SSE} is a potential cause of false single-nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) calls and also significantly hinders de novo assembly. This article highlights the importance of recognizing {SSE} and its underlying mechanisms in the hope of enhancing the potential usefulness of the Illumina sequencers.},

	abstract = {Considerable time and effort has been spent in developing analysis and quality assessment methods to allow the use of microarrays in a clinical setting. As is the case for microarrays and other high-throughput technologies, data from new high-throughput sequencing technologies are subject to technological and biological biases and systematic errors that can impact downstream analyses. Only when these issues can be readily identified and reliably adjusted for will clinical applications of these new technologies be feasible. Although much work remains to be done in this area, we describe consistently observed biases that should be taken into account when analyzing high-throughput sequencing data. In this article, we review current knowledge about these biases, discuss their impact on analysis results, and propose solutions.},
